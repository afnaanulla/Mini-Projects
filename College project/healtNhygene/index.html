                In olden days, people do not have any proper health and hygiene facilities. 
                whenever they get sick they use homemade herbal medicine to cure there illness. 
                Herbal medicines are those with active ingredients made from plant parts, such as leaves, roots or flowers. 
                It is very important for every individual to take proper precautions to maintain a healthy life. HEALTH is the condition of being sound in body, mind, or spirit, especially freedom from physical disease or pain. 
                A healthy body is maintained by good nutrition, regular exercise, avoiding harmful habits, making informed and responsible decisions about health, and seeking medical assistance when necessary. 
                HYGIENE is defined as a set of practices that are necessary to prevent the spread of disease and preserve health. People typically achieve this by maintaining the cleanliness of their body and the environment they live in. 
                Hygiene is essential for staying healthy, as it reduces the chances of getting sick.

            Both personal and community health are important for the well-being of an individual as well as the community. 
            Health may be affected by the environment, availability of quality food and other necessities. 
            Our team prepared the questions regarding the health and hygiene for the  project survey in such a way to implement the health and hygiene in their daily lives. 
            We got to learn about their daily lifestyle ,educational standards, habits, that slum dwellers and children’s are facing. 
            As a part of our community service project, we visited few houses in STBL kapujaggurajupeta. 
            We have asked them some questions to know about the measures they are taking to maintain theirs as well as community health. 
            Sanitation plays a major role in maintaining an individual’s health.

            A community based survey was carried out among the people in STBL, kapujagurajupeta, Visakhapatnam. 
            After interacting with people we identified problems on sanitation rather than health. 
            The people residing there are not having major health issues. 
            The overall objective is to identify various issues regarding the people’s health and hygiene and to create awareness among them with a good alternative to maintain good health and sanitation.
